## Description
Looking Glass is a Maya scripted plugin and Android application that allow a Maya user to use their Project Tango mobile device as a virtual camera capture device. The application shows a live view of the current camera frame as displayed in the Maya viewport. Users are be able to record camera motion in the application by playing the animation scene in real time. The app allows the Maya camera to be controlled by the position and rotation of the device. For example, if the user wants to pan the Maya camera to the left they can turn their device to the left to control the camera in Maya.
